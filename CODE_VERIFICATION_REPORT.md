**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Lines 1-26 - Complete implementation
✅ POST endpoint configured
✅ Calls analyzeSubmission() with proper parameters
✅ Returns JSON response
✅ Error handling with try/catch
✅ Proper Next.js API route structure
```

### 3. Form Submission Integration (`src/app/submission/page.tsx`)

**Status:** ✅ REAL & FUNCTIONAL

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Lines 222-261 - AI analysis trigger on form submit
✅ Calls /api/analyze endpoint
✅ Passes all form data (department, metrics, initiatives, etc.)
✅ Includes financial data (historicalData, budgetData)
✅ Stores results in localStorage
✅ Displays on dashboard
✅ Graceful error handling (continues even if AI fails)
```

### 4. Data Flow Verification

**Complete Request → Response Flow:**

```
User submits form (page.tsx:191)
  ↓
handleSubmit() validates form (page.tsx:199)
  ↓
Calls fetch('/api/analyze', {...}) (page.tsx:225)
  ↓
API route receives request (route.ts:4)
  ↓
analyzeSubmission() called (route.ts:8)
  ↓
buildAnalysisPrompt() creates prompt (ai-analysis.ts:46)
  ↓
client.messages.create() calls Claude API (ai-analysis.ts:54)
  ↓
parseAIResponse() processes result (ai-analysis.ts:77)
  ↓
validateAnalysisResponse() checks quality (ai-analysis.ts:95)
  ↓
Returns to API route (route.ts:17)
  ↓
Stores in localStorage (page.tsx:244)
  ↓
Redirects to dashboard (page.tsx:304)
```

## ⚠️ Critical Issue Found & Resolved

### Issue: Missing API Configuration

**Problem:**
- `.env.local` file was missing
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not configured
- App would run but AI analysis would fail

**Resolution:** ✅ FIXED
- Created `.env.local` with placeholder
- Created `.env.example` for reference
- Added API_SETUP_GUIDE.md with detailed instructions
- Updated README.md with prominent API key requirement
- Created check-config.ps1 to validate setup

### Required Action:
**User must replace placeholder API key with real key from Anthropic Console**

---

## 📊 API Cost Estimate

**Per Analysis:**
- Input tokens: ~5,000 tokens ≈ $0.015
- Output tokens: ~3,000 tokens ≈ $0.045
- **Total: ~$0.06 per submission**

**Free Tier ($5 credit):**
- Can process ~80-85 budget submissions
- Sufficient for testing and small teams

---

## ✅ Testing Recommendations

### Minimal Test Case:
1. Configure API key in `.env.local`
2. Start server: `.\start-dev.ps1`
3. Navigate to New Submission
4. Fill out:
   - Section 1: Department name, team description
   - Section 2: Add 2-3 business metrics
   - Section 4: Add 1-2 initiatives
   - Section 6: Upload sample financial CSV (optional)
5. Submit form
6. Check browser console (F12) for logs
7. View results on dashboard

### Expected Console Output:
```
