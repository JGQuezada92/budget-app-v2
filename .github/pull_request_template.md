## 💥 Breaking Changes

### ⚠️ **Critical Breaking Changes:**

#### 1. **FormData Structure Incompatible**
**What breaks:** FY25/FY26 submissions cannot load into FY27 form without migration  
**Why:** 50+ new required fields, nested object structure  
**Migration Path:** Use MIGRATION_GUIDE.md (8-12 hours per submission)  
**Affected Users:** All users with existing submissions  

#### 2. **Section 5 Complete Restructure**
**What breaks:** Old "Resources" section data structure completely different  
**Why:** Simple HC → comprehensive AI workforce planning  
**Migration Path:** Must rebuild Section 5 manually  
**Affected Users:** All users  

#### 3. **Database Schema Changes**
**What breaks:** Old queries to removed/renamed columns  
**Why:** FY25-27 column shift, new tables  
**Migration Path:** Run schema.sql, update queries  
**Affected Systems:** Reports, dashboards, exports  

#### 4. **API Response Structure**
**What breaks:** Code expecting old analysis format (4 sections)  
**Why:** Added kpiSuggestions, aiReadinessScore (8 sections total)  
**Migration Path:** Update consumers to handle new fields  
**Affected Systems:** Dashboard, admin views  

---

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility Maintained:**

- ✅ FY25/FY26 fiscal years still supported
- ✅ Legacy metric columns preserved in database
- ✅ Old submissions viewable (read-only)
- ✅ File uploads unchanged
- ✅ Authentication unchanged
- ✅ Graceful degradation for missing AI fields

---

## 🔄 Migration Required

### Database Migration:
```bash
# Step 1: Backup
pg_dump -U user -d database > backup_pre_fy27.sql

# Step 2: Run migrations
psql -U user -d database -f schema.sql

# Step 3: Verify
psql -U user -d database -c "\dt ai_*"
```

### Data Migration:
**Effort per submission:** 8-12 hours  
**Process:** See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md sections  
**Recommended:** Pilot with 2-3 departments first  

**Cannot auto-migrate** - Requires human input for:
- AI strategy articulation
- AI retrospective reflections
- AI Integration Plans per initiative
- Strategic FAQ responses

## 👀 Reviewer Notes

### Focus Review On:

**Priority 1 (Critical):**
1. **Database schema changes** (`schema.sql`)
   - Verify all new tables have proper foreign keys
   - Check indexes are on all FK columns
   - Ensure migration is idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS)
   - Review ON DELETE CASCADE logic

2. **Form validation logic** (`src/lib/form-validation.ts`)
   - Verify all FY27 requirements enforced
   - Check conditional validations (HC justification)
   - Test edge cases
   - Ensure helpful error messages

3. **Type safety** (`src/types/aop.ts`)
   - Review interface definitions
   - Check for missing required fields
   - Verify type guards work correctly
   - Test default value factories

**Priority 2 (Important):**
4. **AI analysis enhancements** (`src/lib/ai-analysis.ts`)
   - Review 3-dimensional analysis framework
   - Verify prompt includes all FY27 data
   - Check KPI suggestions structure
   - Test AI Readiness Score calculation

5. **Dashboard aggregations** (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)
   - Verify filters work correctly
   - Check chart data calculations
   - Test department isolation (no cross-contamination)
   - Review export functionality placeholder

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have):**
6. **Component UX** (submission components)
   - Review user experience flow
   - Check responsive design
   - Verify color coding consistency
   - Test accessibility features

7. **Sample data quality** (`src/lib/sample-data.ts`)
   - Verify data is realistic
   - Check for consistency across sections
   - Test data loading

### Known Areas to Review:

- **Section 5 complexity:** ResourcesSection.tsx is 711 lines - consider splitting?
- **AI API costs:** Increased 3x - acceptable given value?
- **Migration effort:** 8-12 hours per submission - can we streamline?
- **Bundle size:** +130KB increase - acceptable or optimize further?

### Questions for Reviewer:

1. Should we add auto-save functionality? (current: manual save only)
2. Export functionality - implement now or defer to future PR?
3. Mobile experience - acceptable or needs dedicated mobile views?
4. AI analysis - should it be optional or required?

## 📝 Additional Notes

### What's NOT in this PR:
- ❌ Actual Supabase backend integration (still using localStorage)
- ❌ Real authentication (still mock)
- ❌ PDF/Excel export implementation (UI only)
- ❌ Email notifications
- ❌ Webhook integrations
- ❌ Multi-user collaboration

These are intentionally deferred to future PRs to keep scope manageable.

### What's Next (Future PRs):
1. Supabase backend integration
2. Real authentication with row-level security
3. PDF/Excel export functionality
4. Email notifications on submission
5. Admin approval workflow
6. Commenting and feedback system
7. Auto-save every 2 minutes
8. Bulk import from spreadsheets
